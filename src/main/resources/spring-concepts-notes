To run the test script on qa / stage environment from local / remote, the below command
should be used.
spring.profiles.active=qa,local - This command will run script on qa in local.
spring.profiles.active=stage,remote - This command will run script on stage in remote.

Bean Scope
==========
1. Singleton
2. Prototype

Singleton
==========
By default, the bean scope is Singleton.

1. Only one instance of the Bean.
2. Shared with all the objects.
3. Shared with all the threads.
4. Good for reporting / logging.
5. Avoid mutating instance variables
6. You responsibility is to keep the object thread safe!

Prototype
=========
1. Fresh instance for all.
2. Note: PreDestroy will not be invoked.

To Create Custom Annotation
===========================
Under the Spring base folder, follow the below steps.
1. create a package and choose Java class, then select type as annotation.
2. Give the name for the class and create it.
3. Add the annotations as below
   a. @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) - It denotes that this annotation should be available at Runtime.
   b. @Target({ElementType.TYPE}) - It denotes that this annotation is applied to classes.
4. Now, the annotations whatever we need to group to create custom annotation can be added.
5. For example, if we need to create the custom annotation for below,
   a. @Component
   b. @Scope("prototype")
   c. @Lazy
The above annotations can be added to the annotation class to use the annotation class as alias in
place of all these 3 annotations.

Application Context Overview
============================
Spring IOC Container is a place where spring would create the beans and maintains it.

File/Resource Handling
======================
Use classpath, when the file is part of the project.
Use file, when the file is external.
Use http, when the file is from web.

Syntax:
=======
@Value("classpath:features/data.csv")
@Value("file:/home/learning/data.csv")
@Value("https://www.google.com")

ResourceLoader
==============
1. To get the resources at runtime (Similar to application context to get the beans at runtime).

PropertiesLoaderUtils
=====================
1. To load N number of property files at runtime.

@PropertySource
===============
1. To read any additional property files which are not part of the application.properties.
2. Instead of injecting values in multiple places, just inject once.
3. Properties into a Java Object.

@TestPropertySource
===================
To set the test specific properties.
