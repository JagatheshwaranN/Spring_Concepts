Bean Scope
==========
1. Singleton
2. Prototype

Singleton
==========
By default, the bean scope is Singleton.

1. Only one instance of the Bean.
2. Shared with all the objects.
3. Shared with all the threads.
4. Good for reporting / logging.
5. Avoid mutating instance variables
6. You responsibility is to keep the object thread safe!

Prototype
=========
1. Fresh instance for all.
2. Note: PreDestroy will not be invoked.

To Create Custom Annotation
===========================
Under the Spring base folder, follow the below steps.
1. create a package and choose Java class, then select type as annotation.
2. Give the name for the class and create it.
3. Add the annotations as below
   a. @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) - It denotes that this annotation should be available at Runtime.
   b. @Target({ElementType.TYPE}) - It denotes that this annotation is applied to classes.
4. Now, the annotations whatever we need to group to create custom annotation can be added.
5. For example, if we need to create the custom annotation for below,
   a. @Component
   b. @Scope("prototype")
   c. @Lazy
The above annotations can be added to the annotation class to use the annotation class as alias in
place of all these 3 annotations.
